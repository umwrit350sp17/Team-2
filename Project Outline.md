Team 2: Project Outline
</b>
<p>
I. Introduction
  1. Why did we choose this tool?
  1. The goal of this project is to find an openly-resourced tool that would be most helpful and can easily replace expensive software for a Writing 101 student. PDF.js is an exceptionally whitty tool for downloading PDF documents without the hassel of downloading ADOBE or other expensive, time-consuming products, because of it's ability to utilize HTML and JAVA, which are essentially the language of the internet. By using this already programmed language, which is used universally, students can read PDF docs without having to download external software. This is because PDF.js requires no downloading at all, the PDF information is simply transcribed into HTML or JAVA format inside the browser. 
  2. Why is this tool marketable to Writ 101 students? (Necessity, eaiser to use) *needs to be 250 words 
       -Content: The audience Profile should contain at least the following information
¥	Use case scenario for a specific member of the audience (detailed: John Smith at UM in a WRIT 100 class in Fall 2018, etc)
¥	Technical background and competencies of audience demographic (you may need to back this up with a source. Check out Pew Internet Foundation for data.
¥	Limitations of the proposed document for the audience.

2. PDF.js is an easily marketable tool because unlike ADOBE Acrobat or other PDF readers, it does not require the use of downloading external readers at all. The user can read PDF documents inside of a web browser using PDF.js because PDF.js simply transcribes the reader into HTML or JAVA code of the internet browser. 

This open-resource would be useful for a Writing 101 student because the user is not plagued with the hassles of outside software (i.e. updating software, making sure software has not given computer a virus). Another benefit of the PDF.js is due to its native usage within a web browser, instead of external download, one is less likely to "catch a virus", which is a risk all users are exposed to each time they make a download to their computer. 

  3. Why does our team feel passionately about this tool?
  
  Our team feels passionately about this tool because it somewhat provides a layer of protection from viruses, is a free resource, and saves time because PDFs no longer require downloading because of their existence within the web browser insteda of external software. The benefits of this tool are important for students at all levels, but especially important for entry level because of their mass exposure to new and much longer materials than what they are probably used to. 

II. What is (Chosen Open-Access Tool)?
  1. What's the function?
  2. Why was is created?  
  3. Who created it?
  4. Is it widely used?
  5. How do I get it? (Post URLs to get to access the tool)

III. How to Use (Open-Access Tool)
  1. What are the tools that this mode of open-access utilizes or replaces?
  2. Which demonstration examples will be used?
  3. ¥	Specify overall organization of documentation (will you break up into folders folder or just individual files? Will you use longer files or shorter/more numerous files?)
¥	Specify use of multimedia content (screenshots, videos, other images)
¥	Specify preliminary external links and sources that you may want to include
¥	Provide general outline of the content, including
	How the document will be introduced
	The order of presentation of the instructions
	How many steps/units of the process

                                                                  
IV. Conclusion
  1. Why would this tool be useful to a student in Writ 101
  2. What's the first step?
