Team 2: Project Outline
Title: Using PDF.js to Access PDF Documents
</b>
<p>
Michael Scott is enrolled in a Writing 101 course at The University of Mississippi. He has never been required to download a longer PDF document onto his computer, because at Dunder Mifflin Highschool he was not required to do so. He isn't even sure how he can read any of the assigned readings for this course without a subscription to a PDF Reader. Like Michael Scott, many internet users do not know how to use desktop applications if they have not had prior exposure, and because of this, he is very nervouse about reading his assigned materials on his computer. 

His friend, Dwight Schrute, recommends PDF.js, a free PDF reader that does not require external downloading and is completely free. Schrute explains that this software can be used inside of Michael's internet browser, rather than having to download the documents his professor has put up on Blackboard. The software is also useful because it protects users from viruses because it requires no outside downloading and utilizes universal HTML and JAVA code. PDF.js is accessible through most browsers and is best accessed through Firefox or Chrome. 

PDF.js is an open-source tool that is easily accessible for "native-usage" inside of a web-browser. If students begin to have trouble accesses PDF.js, they can refer to our Step-By-Step Guide for using PDF.js.

I. Introduction
</p>
<p>
  1. Why did we choose this tool?
  1. The goal of this project is to find an openly-resourced tool that would be most helpful and can easily replace expensive software for a Writing 101 student. PDF.js is an exceptionally whitty tool for downloading PDF documents without the hassel of downloading ADOBE or other expensive, time-consuming products, because of it's ability to utilize HTML and JAVA, which are essentially the language of the internet. By using this already programmed language, which is used universally, students can read PDF docs without having to download external software. This is because PDF.js requires no downloading at all, the PDF information is simply transcribed into HTML or JAVA format inside the browser.

  2. Why is this tool marketable to Writ 101 students? (Necessity, eaiser to use) *needs to be 250 words 
       -Content: The audience Profile should contain at least the following information
¥	Use case scenario for a specific member of the audience (detailed: John Smith at UM in a WRIT 100 class in Fall 2018, etc)
¥	Technical background and competencies of audience demographic (you may need to back this up with a source. Check out Pew Internet Foundation for data.
¥	Limitations of the proposed document for the audience.

2. PDF.js is an easily marketable tool because unlike ADOBE Acrobat or other PDF readers, it does not require the use of downloading external readers at all. The user can read PDF documents inside of a web browser using PDF.js because PDF.js simply transcribes the reader into HTML or JAVA code of the internet browser. 

This open-resource would be useful for a Writing 101 student because the user is not plagued with the hassles of outside software (i.e. updating software, making sure software has not given computer a virus). Another benefit of the PDF.js is due to its native usage within a web browser, instead of external download, one is less likely to "catch a virus", which is a risk all users are exposed to each time they make a download to their computer.

  3. Why does our team feel passionately about this tool?
  
  Our team feels passionately about this tool because it somewhat provides a layer of protection from viruses, is a free resource, and saves time because PDFs no longer require downloading because of their existence within the web browser insteda of external software. The benefits of this tool are important for students at all levels, but especially important for entry level because of their mass exposure to new and much longer materials than what they are probably used to. 

II. What is (Chosen Open-Access Tool)?
  1. What's the function?
  2. Why was is created?  
  3. Who created it?
  4. Is it widely used?
  5. How do I get it? (Post URLs to get to access the tool)

III. How to Use (Open-Access Tool)

  1. What are the tools that this mode of open-access utilizes or replaces?
  	-Replaces software such as Adobe Acrobate, Sumatra PDF, and other downloadable software
	
  2. Which demonstration examples will be used?
 	-Our instructions adhere to the following outline, listed below is the sequence by which our tutorial will follow. All information will be broken down into different files instead of folders because there are few tasks faced by users when using this reader. 
	<ul>
	<li> Finding PDF.js ( https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/getting_started/#download )
	<li> Using example PDFs (screenshots), how to open PDFs in PDF.js (screenshots)
	<li> Screenshots of differences between external readers (ADOBE) versus PDF.js (images) (maybe video)
	<li> How to use PDF.js shortcuts in browser ( https://web.archive.org/web/20160408133647/https://blog.mozilla.org/cjones/2011/06/15/overview-of-pdf-js-guts/  and https://andreasgal.com/2011/06/15/pdf-js/ )
	</ul>
	

                                                                  
IV. Conclusion
  1. Why would this tool be useful to a student in Writ 101
  2. What's the first step?
