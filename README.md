PDF.js is a online PDF reader than was originally embedded within the code of Firefox browser. In response to the need for this application on a different web browser, specifically GOOGLE CHROME, our group has decided to undertake the project of creating a tutorial about accessing this PDF reader.

Our group will not be licensing this project because PDF.js is a free service and we believe that everyone should be able to access this free PDF service.
