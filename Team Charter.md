Team Charter
__________________________
Macro Project Goals:

1. Create a cohesive idea that is prevalent throughout, and without straying from the intended topic
2. To develop a Step-by-Step guide to using our chosen software
3. Create and present work that is aesthetically desireable and marketable

Micro Team Goals:

1. Keep in contact, create an easily accessible mode of communication
2. Present ideas thoroughly to the group as a whole
3. Meet Sunday deadlines; create team deadlines to meet throughout the week
4. Fulfill project requirements stated in weekly project guidelines

Group Member Goals: 
Skylar: 
1. Create work that is easily marketable to our intended target publics. We want to create work that can be used if picked up by either a marketing or Public Relations campaign (Important to show the accessibility of Open-Source Materials).
2. Create a workspace that is inclusive to all team members; allowing all members to contribute equally and resourcefully
3. Learn about our chosen software and potentially implement what I learn into my own technical regimen. 
Rosalee:
Kelsey:
1. Allow all team members to share ideas and contribute to the project.
2. Stay in communication with team members and make sure we are all on the same page. 
3. Meet all deadlines and deliver an amazing project that we all can learn from in order to strengthen our digital writing delivery. 


Individual Committments: 

Skylar Sandroni: I plan to contribute as much time and effort needed to complete this project. If decided to split the work threeways, I will be willing to contribute extra time, if needed, to do extra research or other clerical needs. 

Rosalee Severino:

Kelsey Donovan: I plan to contribute my time and effort to the group and project. If we need to meet in person to discuss or work on it to avoid miscommunication, I will be willing to do that as well.


Project Concerns: 

Skylar: 
I. I am currently enrolled in 18 hours at the University of Mississippi, working at the University of Mississippi Writing Center, and interning  at the Oxford-Lafayette County Chamber of Commerce. In my free time,  which is usually Friday, Saturday and Sunday, I work on all projects due for Writing 350. The best way to get in contact with me is text. I am not free to meet throughout the week, but I can easily message my groupmates when necessary.  

II. If we can delegate our workload equally, then I believe we might be able to work on the projects throughout the week, rather than solely on the weekends. 

III. I don't believe there will be many concerns if all group members keep in contact and track eachother's progress throughout the week. 

Rosalee:

Kelsey:
I. I am currently in 19 hours at the University of Mississippi and in Air Force ROTC, a demanding program. I also work on Writ 350 assignments during the weekend. I can schedule time to meet during the week, or schedule video conference sessions.

II. Communication within the group needs to be strong, so that we are all on the same page. I think this wil be achieved through our Groupchat. As long as we avoid miscommunication, I believe the project will run smoothly.


Conflict Resolution: 
If an issue arises from our project, the entire group must agree on an intended outcome. There will be no majority rules, the entire group must feel comfortable presenting their portion of the project. Out of respect of all group members, we must all agree on the work that will be done and contributed to this project task. 

Unacceptable work:
Work will be unacceptable if-

I. Information is false and misleading. Content will be taken down immediately. 

II. If there is question about the "necessity" of an article of information, it should be contested by the group as a whole. If decided unanimously that the information is relevant, the information will remain. If otherwise, information will be omitted. 

III. Revision: If sections of our project is vague, confusing, word-y, or grammatically incorrect, ALL group members will reread and make suggestions about how to correct the problem. 

Missed Deadlines:
I. If it is perceived that one group member will miss their given deadline, then it is the obligation of both group members will "take up the reins" and do the work that will not make deadline.
